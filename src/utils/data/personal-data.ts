  description : "I'm Hiba, a dedicated and enthusiastic Full-Stack Developer with a strong passion for building modern web applications that are both functional and user-friendly. I recently graduated from the Specialized Institute of Applied Technology NTIC, where I specialized in digital development and gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. Throughout my journey, I've developed a deep interest in creating dynamic interfaces using React.js, designing secure and scalable REST APIs with Laravel, and managing data efficiently with MySQL and MongoDB. I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and bringing ideas to life through clean, maintainable solutions. Beyond coding, I thrive in collaborative environments, value clean design, and continuously seek to improve by exploring new technologies and best practices in web development. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, exchange ideas, or just talk tech!" ,
